## Wide layouts for ABNT2 keyboards.

Please note that the images do not reflect the layout exactly, it is missing a key due to a bug in the way Gnome renders the layout. It renders the keyboard as having an ISO layout. ABNT2 keybords have an extra key to the left of Right Shift, ";" on br-wide and "/" on us-wide)

The inspiration behind this came from wanting to customize my keyboard, without having to learn a completely new layout such as Dvorak, Colemak, etc. I wanted something easy to pick up and that my friends and family would be able to use without any problems.

The hands are spaced a bit further apart which helps ergonomics a tiny bit. More importantly, since the keys on the right side of the keyboard are shifted one key to the right; Backspace, Enter, Shift, CTRL and AltGr are a bit closer and the right pinky does not have to move as far.

I got inspiration to do this after reading this...
